simple mark-up strategy
	for each row in matrix
		for each col in matrix
			if current spot == 0 or current spot’s value has length > 1
				rowColPossibilities = get possibilities for row and col based on the current spot
				groupPossibilities = get possibilities for the group that current spot is in
				current spot = intersection of possibilities for rowColPossibilities and groupPossibilities
naked pair strategy
	for each row in matrix
		for each col in matrix
			if current spot has naked pair in row then eliminate it
			if current spot has naked pair in col then eliminate it
			if current spot has naked pair in group then eliminate it
